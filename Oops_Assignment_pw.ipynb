        "  1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes data and behavior into objects, combining attributes (data) and methods (functions) to model real-world entities and relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior. It represents a specific entity created using the structure defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, bundling data and methods together for data protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Dunder (double underscore) methods, such as __init__, __str__, and __repr__, are special methods in Python. They allow customization of class behavior and are invoked implicitly by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical class relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It supports the ability to define a method in multiple ways depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private and protected access modifiers. Prefixing an attribute with _ or __ restricts its access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A constructor in Python is a special method, __init__, automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Class methods (@classmethod) operate on the class level, receiving cls as the first argument. Static methods (@staticmethod) do not depend on the class or instance and are utility-like.\n",
        "\n",
        "  11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Python does not natively support method overloading. However, you can achieve it by providing default arguments or by checking the argument types inside a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. It allows customizing behavior in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The @property decorator in Python allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism increases code flexibility and reusability by allowing methods to work with objects of different classes without knowing their exact type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. It is defined using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "  16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  OOP promotes modularity, code reusability, scalability, and easier debugging by modeling programs as interacting objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  A class variable is shared across all instances of a class, while an instance variable is specific to each object and defined in the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. It is supported natively in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  __str__ provides a human-readable string representation of an object, while __repr__ gives an unambiguous representation for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "  20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The super() function allows access to the methods of a parent class, enabling method overriding and avoiding repetitive code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing cleanup of resources like closing files or connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "  22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  @staticmethod does not access or modify class state, while @classmethod operates on the class level and can access and modify class-level variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism in Python allows a child class to override a parent class method, enabling different behaviors for the same method name in different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object sequentially in a single statement by returning self from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "  25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The __call__ method allows an object to be called as a function. Defining this method in a class makes its instances callable."
